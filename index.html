                <p>Dear Reader,</p>
                <p>
                    How often have you had an array of strings and wished 
                    you could capitalize each word? If you answered “all the time”, 
                    then you came to the right place. 
                    Today we're going to iterate on an array so that every word in the array is capitalized.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some questions to ask yourself before you begin. What's in the array? Is it a string? 
                    It better be. Within that string, you probably have multiple words separated by spaces. 
                    Uh-oh. Is that another string after that? 
                    How are you going to capitalize not only all of the words in the first string, but the one after that? 
                    Not to fear, Jeena is here.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's take it step by step. Take a look at the array. 
                </p>
                <pre>
        const tutorials = [
        "what does the this keyword mean?",
        "What is the Constructor OO pattern?",
        "implementing Blockchain Web API",
        "The Test driven Development Workflow",
        ];
                </pre>
                <p>
                    We want every string in the array to be titlecased, meaning every word should be capitalized. 
                    Your result should look like this.
                </p>
                <pre>
        const tutorials = [
        "What Does The This Keyword Mean?",
        "What Is The Constructor OO Pattern?",
        "Implementing Blockchain Web API",
        "The Test Driven Development Workflow"
        ];
                </pre>
                <p>
                    First, how can we iterate through the individual words in each string? 
                    If you thought to yourself “.split”, then have an extra oreo tonight. 
                    How does .split work? .split is a JavaScript method on String that takes a string to separate by, called a delimiter. 
                    Then it returns an array of the separate parts of the string. 
                    If you have a string containing words, those words are going to be separated by spaces.  
                    So if you want to get an array of the words within a string, you can call on .split with a space as the argument and this will return an array of the words. 
                </p>
                <pre>
    "What Does The This Keyword Mean?".split(“ ”);

    Returns [“What”, “Does”, “The”, “This”, “Keyword”, “Mean?”];                    
                </pre>
                <p>
                    Okay, but Jeena, how do I do this if I have more than one string in my array? 
                    Great question! There's something we can do to iterate on an array that returns a modified one. 
                    Take a guess. Did you say “.map”? Woohoo, have another oreo! .map is another JavaScript method that operates on an array and returns an equal length array that contains a modified version of each element of the original array. What do you mean “a modified version of each element”? How does it modify it? .map takes a callback function and executes it on each element in an array. 
                </p>
                <pre>
        const tutorials = [
        "what does the this keyword mean?",
        "What is the Constructor OO pattern?",
        "implementing Blockchain Web API",
        "The Test driven Development Workflow",
        ];

        tutorials.map(string => string.split(“ ”))

        Returns [
        ["what”, “does”, “the”, “this”, “keyword”, “mean?"],
        ["What”, “is”, “the”, “Constructor”, “OO”, “pattern?"],
        ["implementing”, “Blockchain”, “Web”, “API"],
        ["The”, “Test”, “driven”, “Development”, “Workflow"],
        ];
                </pre>
                <p>
                    Err now what? How can we capitalize every word? First we want to grab the first letter in each word 
                    using .charAt(0) and call .toUpperCase() in order to capitalize each word. But what about the rest 
                    of the letters? We can use another String method called “.slice”. .slice takes in an index as its parameter 
                    and returns a string of the letters from the indicated index onwards. From here, we can concatenate in 
                    order to rebuild a capitalized word. 
                </p>
                <pre>
    “javascript”.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + “javascript”.slice(1);

    Returns “Javascript”;
                </pre>
                <p>
                    Great Jeena, but there are more words. What do with them? Well, it looks like each word is an element 
                    in an array within an array. How can we iterate on each element of an array and return a modified version? 
                    That's right, our old friend .map. Since .map takes in a callback function, we can create a function that 
                    capitalizes each word and use that on each of our strings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Putting things together now, let's start with our first array of strings. We know how to split each string 
                    into words in a new array. With that new array, we can capitalize each word within it. 
                    Let's see what this looks like in code. 
                </p>
                <pre>
arrayOfSentences.map((sentence) => sentence.split(“ ”))
    .map((arrayOfWords) => arrayOfWords
        .map((word) => word.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + word.slice(1));

Returns [
["What Does The This Keyword Mean?"],
["What Is The Constructor OO Pattern?"],
["Implementing Blockchain Web API"],
["The Test Driven Development Workflow"]
];
                </pre>
                <p>
                    This is almost what we want, but it returns an array of arrays. What now? 
                    We can use .join() to join all of the strings in an array into one string.
                    Note that it returns a string, not an array. 
                    So if we add that on, now our code looks like this. 
                </p>
                <pre>
arrayOfSentences.map((sentence) => sentence.split(“ ”))
    .map((arrayOfWords) => arrayOfWords
        .map((word) => word.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + word.slice(1))
    .map((arrayOfWords) => arrayOfWords.join());

Returns [
"What Does The This Keyword Mean?",
"What Is The Constructor OO Pattern?",
"Implementing Blockchain Web API",
"The Test Driven Development Workflow"
];
                </pre>
                <p>
                    Now that we have our final code, let's walk through the steps that it took to get here. 
                    We started with an array of strings and we wanted to capitalize each word within each string. 
                    So, we started by using .split() to split each string into individual words. 
                    We then used .map() to execute .split() on each string within our original array. 
                    We were returned a new array, within the original array, full of the strings that 
                    represented the individual words. Then, we used another .map() on that array of arrays to 
                    capitalize the first letter in each word and return it. So now we have an array of arrays. 
                    The inner arrays now contain the words that are capitalized. Finally we use .join() to join 
                    all of the words in each inner array so that they all contain one string. And voila! 
                    We have an array of strings with each word capitalized.
